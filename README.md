# Werewolves of Miller's Hollow - Agents and Distributed AI

## Overview

[Werewolves of Miller's Hollow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Werewolves_of_Millers_Hollow) is a board-free game. Its action revolves around negotiation and trust. Players secretly take on the roles of villagers or werewolves, and have to try to survive until the opposing team dies. The werewolves know the identity of the other werewolves, and have to play as a team to kill the villagers.

## Objectives

In addition to the implementation of the game itself, the job is to develop players of various types (random, strategic, BDI, ...) in order to compare their performance.
